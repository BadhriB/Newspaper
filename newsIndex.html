                <p><img src="shield.jpg" class="army" alt="Simply Easy Learning" style="float: left">AHMEDABAD: An especially infective Covid variant known as N440K has a mutation in its spike protein and had lingered for quite a while in the southern states along with the now dominant double mutant B.1.617. It is B.1.617 that has wreaked havoc across the country during the second wave. But few know that the N440K variant was also seen in Gujarat in at least nine Covid samples of the 293 tested between January and April 24 this year.
                    This fact was revealed in a research paper published recently by the Academy for Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), headquartered on the CSIR campus in Ghaziabad.</p>

                <p>NEW DELHI: The US government’s top infectious disease scientist, Dr Anthony Fauci, is in the eye of a storm after hundreds of his private emails were recently made public by two US media outlets. The emails have revealed details of his correspondence between February and April 2020 when Covid-19 cases were surging throughout the US.
                    Buzzfeed News and The Washington Post gained access to the thousands of pages of communication under the Freedom of Information Act.
                    While the email trove gives information about how Fauci was juggling crisis calls, Republicans have pointed out that the emails verify their claims about the top official misleading the US public on Covid-19 origins.</p>
